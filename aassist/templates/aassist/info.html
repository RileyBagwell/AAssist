            <p>
                Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant. After drinking, it is absorbed primarily in
                the small intestine and to a lesser extent in the stomach, entering the bloodstream and traveling to the
                brain. Its effects scale with blood alcohol concentration (BAC), typically measured as grams of alcohol
                per deciliter of blood.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Onset</strong>: Most effects begin within 10â€“30 minutes, faster on an empty stomach.</li>
                <li><strong>Metabolism</strong>: The liver breaks down most alcohol via alcohol dehydrogenase. Typical
                    elimination is about 0.015% BAC per hour (varies by person).</li>
                <li><strong>Factors</strong>: Body mass, sex, genetics, food, medications, and drinking pace all affect
                    BAC and impairment.</li>
                <li><strong>Impairment</strong>: Even low BAC can impair judgment, coordination, and reaction time.</li>

            <h2 class="h4">What is a standard drink?</h2>
            <p>
                A standard drink is a way to compare different beverages by their pure alcohol content. In the U.S., one
                standard drink contains about <strong>14 grams (0.6 fl oz) of pure alcohol</strong>.

                ABV = alcohol by volume. Craft beers, fortified wines, and cocktails can contain more than one standard
                drink per serving.

            <h2 class="h4">Estimating BAC</h2>
            <p>
                BAC rises as drinks are consumed and falls as the body metabolizes alcohol. Simple estimators (like the
                Widmark formula) can give ballpark figures, but real BAC varies widely. The safest assumption is that you
                are impaired if you have been drinking.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time</strong> lowers BAC slowly: roughly 0.015% per hour after drinking stops.</li>
                <li><strong>Coffee, cold showers, exercise</strong> do not speed up metabolism.</li>
                <li><strong>Never drive</strong> after drinking. Use a designated driver or rideshare.</li>
